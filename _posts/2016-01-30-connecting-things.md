# Hello world

In 2014, I learned about a project called The Grid,  a new website builder service based on artificial intelligence. The idea:

> The Grid harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to take everything you throw at it - videos, images, text, urls and more - and automatically shape them into a custom website unique to you. [The Grid][0]

This immediately caught my attention. If you've ever used one of today's popular website builders such as [Wordpress][1], you'll know why. You easily get trapped spending hours with the layout and design of your site, keeping you from actually publishing stuff.

The idea of "concentrating on contents and let the machine do the rest for you" was just the perfect sales pitch for me. Eventually, I decided to spend a little money to become a founding member and get beta-access .

# From high expectations to "this sucks" to getting started

However, it didn't take long to realize that at this moment,  The Grid is just not there yet. While it is possible to at least create a very basic website, even the people at The Grid admit that "(...) it sucks in it's current state". Little surprisingly, their founding members - including myself - were rather disappointed. I was just about to lose patience and move to another service, when I stepped back and thought again.

Creativity under constraints

See the potential in humans, too.
