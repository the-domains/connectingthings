# Hello world

In 2014, I learned about a project called "The Grid",  a new website builder service based on artificial intelligence. The idea:

> The Grid harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to take everything you throw at it - videos, images, text, urls and more - and automatically shape them into a custom website unique to you. [The Grid][0]

This immediately caught my attention. If you've ever used one of today's popular website builders such as [Wordpress][1], you'll know why. You easily get trapped spending hours with the layout and design of your site, keeping you from actually publishing stuff.

The idea of "concentrating on contents and let the machine do the rest for you" was just the perfect sales pitch for me. Eventually, I decided to spend a little money to become a founding member and get beta-access .

# From high expectations to "this sucks"

However, it didn't take long to realize that at its current state, the grid is just not there yet. Yes, it is possible to create a very basic website with grid.       But many things are still under development. 

However, it was not until early 2016 when I finally got access to the beta version of The Grid. However, when I got access to the first beta version, disappointment was big. The kind of websites you could create with the beta version didn't meet my expectations. In fact, the beta version of The Grid was so limited in its functionalities, you could only build very basic websites. So basic, that I was just about to lose patience and choose another service.
