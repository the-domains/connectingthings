# Connecting things

In 2014, I learned about a project called "The Grid",  a new website builder service based on artificial intelligence. The idea:

> The Grid harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to take everything you throw at it - videos, images, text, urls and more - and automatically shape them into a custom website unique to you. [The Grid][0]

This immediately caught my attention. If you've ever used one of today's popular website builders such as [Wordpress][1] , you'll know why. You easily get trapped spending hours with the layout and design of your site, keeping you from actually publishing a single thing.

So to me and many others, the idea of "concentrating on contents and let the machine do the rest for you" was just the perfect sales pitch and I decided to spend a little money to become one of the founding members.

However, when I got access to the first beta version, disappointment was big. The kind of websites you could create with the beta version didn't meet my expectations. In fact, the beta version of The Grid was so limited in its functionalities, you could only build very basic websites. So basic, that I was just about to lose patience and choose another service.
