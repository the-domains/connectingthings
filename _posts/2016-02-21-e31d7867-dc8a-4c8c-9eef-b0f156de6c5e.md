# GOODBYE, GENIUSES. HELLO LEGO PLAYERS 

An entirely made up conversation about creativity.

> **[Steve Jobs:][0]** Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. (...) That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.

**[@marginalien][1]:** Right... but wait! While watching Mad Men, I got the impression that it's not that easy. Don't you need talent or at least lots of whisky to come up with great ideas?

> **[Alan:][2]** The creative process is mythicized in our culture. There is a sense that ideas are flashes of genius that people have, all at once. (...) You might think that quote (by Jobs) trivializes the creative process, but I like to think of it as a reminder that we all have the capacity for big, innovative ideas.

So, everybody can be a creative master-mind, as long we have enough diverse experiences that we can connect to each other?  
> 
> **[Steve Jobs:][0]** Unfortunately, that's too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem.

That holds true for many industries, including my own. When you ask people in corporate and brand communications to name just a few inspiring cases, topics or gadgets, they often struggle to do so. And that's because we live in a lobar-divided economy. In our day to day jobs we focus on very specific tasks and clients, which effectively narrows down our view...

> [**Maria Popova:**][3] I think of it as LEGOs --- if the bricks we have are of only one shape, size, and color, we can build things, but there's a limit to how imaginative and interesting they will be. The richer and more diverse that pool of resources, that mental library of building blocks, the more visionary and compelling our combinatorial ideas can be.

...which is why creative sessions should always include an interdisciplinary, mixed group of people. Varied views and backgrounds prevent us from repeating ourselves, an insight that has long been propagated in Design Thinking:

(...)   

What's more, even experienced people who possess a lot of bricks to build aren't necessarily always aware of them! 

So how can we increase our pool of resources from which we can draw and create new ideas? One way to overcome this barrier is to mix teams. A practice well established 

But on the individual level even when you're not focused on a challenging task, the nature of our brains makes it hard for us humans to access and combine many different and diverse elements simultaneously. 

So the first step, then, is to build a box that contains many different building bricks of ideas, right? That shouldn't be a big problem.

> **James Webb Young:** Gathering raw material in a real way is not as simple as it sounds. It is such a terrible chore that we are constantly trying to dodge it. The time that ought to be spent in material gathering is spent in wool gathering. Instead of working systematically at the job of gathering raw material we sit around hoping for inspiration to strike us.

[James Webb Young / A technique for producing ideas][4]

But it certainly is 

But possessing enough things to connect doesn't yet solve the problem. Even though ideas are nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements, you need know how to do that! It is also about...

**James Webb Young:** (...) the capacity to bring old elements into new combinations (which) depends largely on the ability to see relationships. The habit of mind which leads to a search for relationships between facts becomes of the highest importance in the production of ideas.
