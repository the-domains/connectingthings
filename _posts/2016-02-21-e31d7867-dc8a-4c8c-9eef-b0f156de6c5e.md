# GOODBYE GENIUS

## HELLO LEGO BRICKS

A MADE UP CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO BE CREATIVE

> **Steve Jobs:** Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. (...) That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.

[Steve Jobs / 1996 / Wired Magazine][0]

That's an interesting way of thinking about creativity. But it somehow doesn't seem to fit to our common understanding of creativity. Why is that?

> **Alan Cannistraro:** The creative process is mythicized in our culture. There is a sense that ideas are flashes of genius that people have, all at once. (...) You might think that quote (by Jobs) trivializes the creative process, but I like to think of it as a reminder that we all have the capacity for big, innovative ideas.

[Alan Cannistraro / 2016 / Medium.com][1]

So, everybody can be a creative master-mind, as long we have diverse experiences that we can connect to each other?  
> 
> **Steve Jobs:** Unfortunately, that's too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem.

[Steve Jobs / 1996 / Wired Magazine][0]

That seems to hold true for many industries, including my own. When you ask people in corporate and brand communications to name just a few inspiring cases, trends or topics, they often struggle to do so.
