# GOODBYE GENIUS

## HELLO LEGO PLAYERS

A MADE UP CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO BE CREATIVE
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3189a5a1-e0b0-4c2d-956c-6d693f741857.jpg)

> **Steve Jobs:** Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. (...) That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.

[Steve Jobs / 1996 / Wired Magazine][0]

That's an interesting way of thinking about creativity. But it somehow doesn't seem to fit to our common understanding of creativity. Why is that?

> **Alan Cannistraro:** The creative process is mythicized in our culture. There is a sense that ideas are flashes of genius that people have, all at once. (...) You might think that quote (by Jobs) trivializes the creative process, but I like to think of it as a reminder that we all have the capacity for big, innovative ideas.

[Alan Cannistraro / 2016 / Medium.com][1]

So, everybody can be a creative master-mind, as long we have enough diverse experiences that we can connect to each other?  
> 
> **Steve Jobs:** Unfortunately, that's too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem.

[Steve Jobs / 1996 / Wired Magazine][0]

That seems to hold true for many industries, including my own. When you ask people in corporate and brand communications to name just a few inspiring cases, trends or topics, they often struggle to do so. That's because in our day to day jobs, we are often so much focused on very specific tasks and clients. 
> 
> Daniel Kahnemann: Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to stimuli that normally attract attention.

...that's bad news when it comes to the number of things we can possibly connect with each other to form new ideas. 
> 
> **Maria Popova:** I think of it as LEGOs --- if the bricks we have are of only one shape, size, and color, we can build things, but there's a limit to how imaginative and interesting they will be. The richer and more diverse that pool of resources, that mental library of building blocks, the more visionary and compelling our combinatorial ideas can be.

[Maria Popova / Brainpickings.org][2]

So the first step, then, is to build a box that contains many different building bricks of ideas, right? That shouldn't be a big problem.

> **James Webb Young:** Gathering raw material in a real way is not as simple as it sounds. It is such a terrible chore that we are constantly trying to dodge it. The time that ought to be spent in material gathering is spent in wool gathering. Instead of working systematically at the job of gathering raw material we sit around hoping for inspiration to strike us.

[James Webb Young / A technique for producing ideas][3]

But it certainly is 

BBut possessing enough things to connect doesn't yet solve the problem. Even though ideas are nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements, you need know how to do that! It is also about...

**James Webb Young:** (...) the capacity to bring old elements into new combinations (which) depends largely on the ability to see relationships. The habit of mind which leads to a search for relationships between facts becomes of the highest importance in the production of ideas.
