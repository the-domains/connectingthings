## HELLO LEGO BRICKS

A CONVERSATION ABOUT DIFFERENT NOTIONS OF CREATIVITY

> **Steve Jobs:** Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. (...) That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.

[Steve Jobs / 1996 / Wired Magazine][0]

That's an interesting understanding of creativity. To say the least, it doesn't seem to be a very common way of looking at it. But why is that?

> **Alan Cannistraro:** The creative process is mythicized in our culture. There is a sense that ideas are flashes of genius that people have, all at once. (...) You might think that quote (by Jobs) trivializes the creative process, but I like to think of it as a reminder that we all have the capacity for big, innovative ideas.

[Alan Cannistraro / 2016 / Medium.com][1]
